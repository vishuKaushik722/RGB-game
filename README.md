# RGB Guessing Game
RGB Color guessing game based on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp "Color Game Project".

Wrote most of the game on my own, prior to watching the videos and watched the videos on 1.75x speed whenever I got stuck. Also made my own changes to it (added medium mode, changed the size of the squares depending on difficulty, etc).

Play the game on my GitHub pages: [https://esstewart.github.io/RGB-Guessing-Game/](https://esstewart.github.io/RGB-Guessing-Game/)

How to play

1. Game will start on its own or you can select a new difficulty.
2. Look at the randomly selected RGB color value at the top.
3. Click "New Colors" if you don't like the color choices and/or RGB color value.
4. Look at the colored squares and click the one you think that matches the RGB color value.
5. Keep clicking until you guess correctly!
